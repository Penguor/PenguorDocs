 Include
#########

Different to other languages (like, for example, Python or C++), the :code:`include` keyword in Penguor does not reference files, but rather libraries (I decided to call them that, even though they're just namespaces). To compromise this, you can, like in some of those languages, include specific structures from these namespaces using :code:`from ... include ...`.

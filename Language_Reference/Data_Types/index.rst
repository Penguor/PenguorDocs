## Data Type Groups

There are different groups for data types. The most common ones are `num` for numeric data types and `char` for data types containing characters.

## Predefined Data Types

Penguor defines some basic numeric and data types

+-------+---------+-------+
| Type  |  Size   | Group |
+=======+=========+=======+
| byte  | 1 byte  | num   |
| short | 2 bytes | num   |
| int   | 4 bytes | num   |
+-------+---------+-------+


## Custom Data Types

Penguor provides the possibility of creating own data types. A full guide can be found [here](./Custom_Data_Types.md)

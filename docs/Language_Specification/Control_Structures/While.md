# While Loop

A while loop executes its content zero or more times, depending on a condition.

```Penguor
i32 i = 0
while (i < 5) {
    print("Hello World")
    i++
}
print("End of loop")
```

## Condition

The condition is specified in parentheses after the `while` keyword.
It has to evaluate to a boolean value. If the value is `true`, the nested statement will execute.
Otherwise the program will continue after the statement.

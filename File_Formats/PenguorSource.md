# Penguor Source

The source code of a Penguor project is saved in a *.pgr* file.

## Structure

A *pgr* file always starts with a header followed by the imported libraries and the systems/data types/components. As the language is being influenced by C#, it uses curly braces for code blocks and semicolons to end an instruction.

### Header

The header of a file contains several properties for the compiler. The library the code in the file belongs to and the safety level are examples for content which is located in the header.

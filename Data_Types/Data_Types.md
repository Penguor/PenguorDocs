# Data Types

Data types are the basic values of the language.

## Data Type Groups

There are different groups for data types. The most common ones are `num` for numeric data types and `char` for data types containing characters.

## Predefined Data Types

Penguor defines some basic numeric and data types

| Type | Size    | Group |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| byte | 1 byte  | num   |
| int  | 4 bytes | num   |

## Custom Data Types

Penguor provides the possibility of creating own data types. A full guide can be found [here](./Custom_Data_Types.md)

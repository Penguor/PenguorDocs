# Data Types

Data types are the basic values of the language.

## Data Type Groups

There are different groups for data types. The most common ones are `num` for numeric data types and `char` for data types containing characters.

## Predefined Data Types

Penguor defines some basic numeric and data types. These are handled by the compiler, but nonetheless they must be defined in the standard library.

| Type   | Size    | Group |
| ------ | ------- | ----- |
| byte   | 1 byte  | num   |
| short  | 2 bytes | num   |
| int    | 4 bytes | num   |
| long   | 8 bytes | num   |
| float  | 4 bytes | num   |
| double | 8 bytes | num   |
| char   | 1 byte  | char  |
| string | 0-?     | char  |
| bool   | 1 byte  | -     |
| void   | -       | -     |

## Custom Data Types

Penguor provides the possibility of creating custom data types. A full guide can be found [here](./Custom_Data_Types.md)
